# 🐶 Pet Adoption DApp

A decentralized application (DApp) that allows users to adopt pets using Ethereum smart contracts.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project is a full-stack Ethereum DApp that demonstrates how smart contracts, Web3, and a responsive frontend can work together to create a simple, secure pet adoption system on the blockchain.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Solidity** – for smart contracts
- **Truffle** – development framework
- **Ganache CLI** – local Ethereum blockchain
- **Web3.js** – blockchain interaction
- **Bootstrap** – UI styling
- **jQuery** – DOM manipulation
- **MetaMask** – wallet integration

---

## ⚠️ Compatibility Note

Make sure your Solidity version in `pragma` matches the compiler version in `truffle-config.js`. Incompatible versions can cause deployment or runtime issues.

### Used in this project:

- Node.js: `v22.11.0`
- Truffle: `v5.11.5`
- Compiler (in `truffle-config.js`): `0.5.1`
- Solidity pragma: `>=0.4.22 <0.9.0`

## ✨ Highlights

- Seamless MetaMask integration
- Real Ethereum transactions on Ganache
- Fully functional smart contract
- Responsive, interactive pet adoption interface
- Clear adoption status with disabled buttons
